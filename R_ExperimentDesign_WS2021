### Baseline spending determinants analysis

## Run a regression of two spendings on control variables
Model_PreUnfriendly <- lm(BaselineSpendingUnfriendly ~ NumberFamily + NumberCars + BaselineBike + BaselineClimate, data = normdf)
Model_PreFriendly <- lm(BaselineSpendingFriendly ~ NumberFamily + NumberCars + BaselineBike + BaselineClimate, data = normdf)

## Post intervention spending determinants analysis

## linear regression of post-spendings on variables including the interventions
Model_PostUnfriendly <- lm(PostSpendingUnfriendly ~ InjunctiveNorms + DescriptiveNorms + NumberFamily + PostCars + PostBike + PostClimate, data = normdf)
Model_PostFriendly <- lm(PostSpendingFriendly ~ InjunctiveNorms + DescriptiveNorms + NumberFamily + PostCars + PostBike + PostClimate, data = normdf)

summary(Model_PostUnfriendly)

## Changes in the spendings and the interventions

## add columns containing values of the changes in spendings

normdf$deltaUnfriendly <- normdf$PostSpendingUnfriendly - normdf$BaselineSpendingUnfriendly
normdf$deltaFriendly <- normdf$PostSpendingFriendly - normdf$BaselineSpendingFriendly

## Regression of the changes on the intervention only

Model_deltaUnfriendly <- lm(deltaUnfriendly ~ InjunctiveNorms + DescriptiveNorms, data = normdf)
